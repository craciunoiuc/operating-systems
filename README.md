# Operating Systems Assignments
The repository contains skeletons for the homework and implementation for most of them. Each assignment has additional information in its folder.
* A short description for each assignment is listed below.

C Preprocessor (1-multi)
--------------
The assignment is fully implemented and works on both Windows and Linux. It uses the lib-C abstractisation for portability.

Stdio.h Implementation (2-stdio)
-------
The assignment is fully implemented for Windows and Linux, except pipes. It uses system calls to implement a version of the stdio.h header.

Process Loader (3-loader)
--------------
The assignment is mostly implemented for Linux. It uses memory mapping system calls to map an executable file in memory to run it.

Process Scheduler (4-scheduler)
-----------------
Only basic functionality is offered on Linux and Windows. It uses synchronisation offered through system calls to plan processes on the processor.

Asynchronous Web Server (5-aws)
-----------------------
Not implemented.
